        Why is the JavaScript textContent property safer than innerHTML
        </h1>
        <h2>
        textContent looks for ways to only change the text in an element, innerHTML replaces all of the HTML including tags.
        </h2>

        Explain the relationship between an HTML attribute and a corresponding DOM property (explain the connection to JavaScript).
        Use a specific example in your answer.
        </h1>
        <h2>
        HTML atrributes contain the values in the source file that's loaded by the browser. DOM properties are the browsers rendering of the HTML.
        JavaScript doesn't modify the original HTML. Instead, it updates the DOM directly in the browser.

        Example: changing the text of a button from "open" to "close". The original HTML would still have the value as "open",
        but the dom would now display "close" as the button text.
