        When would you use a switch statement in your projects?
    </div>
        <p>
            A switch statement is used for storing a user's specific answer into one variable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ex: Asking a user about their favorite day and storing their answer into a variable that will display their favorite day.
        </p>
    <body>
        <script src="favday.js">
        </script>
    </body>
