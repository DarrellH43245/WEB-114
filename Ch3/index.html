            1. Name a situation where you would need to create an "if" statement.
        </div>
            <p>
                If you needed to verify someone's age, such as making sure someone is over 18.
                You would store the age they answered into a variable and use an "if" statement to
                compare it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ex: if (age &gt;= 18)
            </p>
        <div>
            2. When comparing values, in what data type is the result stored?
        </div>
            <p>
                Boolean, because it stores the values of "true" and "false".
            </p>
